## Test Quality Metrics

### High-Quality Test Examples ✅

**`test_session_timeout_includes_output`**
```python
# Excellent because:
# - Tests actual timeout behavior
# - Verifies error message includes recent output
# - Checks output is truncated appropriately
# - Uses real process interaction
```

**`test_parallel_mixed_results`**
```python
# Excellent because:
# - Tests success and failure in same batch
# - Verifies isolation between commands
# - Checks result aggregation
# - Tests timeout handling
```

**`test_pattern_detection_accuracy`**
```python
# Excellent because:
# - Tests against 37 real prompt patterns
# - Includes edge cases and variations
# - Validates no false positives
# - Performance benchmarked
```

### Medium-Quality Test Examples ⚠️

**`test_investigation_basic`**
```python
# Adequate because:
# - Only tests happy path
# - Uses simple mock program
# - Doesn't test state transitions
# - Missing timeout scenarios
```

**`test_session_reuse`**
```python
# Adequate because:
# - Tests basic reuse
# - Doesn't test concurrent reuse
# - Missing cleanup scenarios
# - No performance validation
```

### Low-Quality Test Examples ❌

**`test_exception_creation`**
```python
# Poor because:
# - Only tests object creation
# - No actual error scenarios
# - Could be removed
```

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Well-Covered Edge Cases ✅
- Empty output from process
- Very long output lines (>10k chars)
- Binary/non-UTF8 output

## Test Improvements Needed

### Priority 1 - Critical Gaps
1. Add streaming/named pipe tests
2. Test resource exhaustion scenarios
3. Add state machine cycle detection tests
4. Test registry corruption recovery

### Priority 2 - Coverage Expansion
1. Increase investigation coverage to 85%
2. Add more fuzz test scenarios
3. Test CLI error handling
4. Add performance regression tests

### Priority 3 - Quality Improvements
1. Reduce test interdependencies
2. Speed up integration tests
3. Add property-based tests for patterns
4. Improve test documentation

## Running Tests Effectively

### Test Organization
```
tests/
├── test_core.py         # Session management (21 tests)
├── test_patterns.py     # Pattern matching (37 tests)
├── test_helpers.py      # Helper functions (18 tests)
├── test_investigate.py  # Investigation (8 tests)
├── test_testing.py      # Black box testing (7 tests)
├── test_integration.py  # End-to-end (12 tests)
└── conftest.py         # Shared fixtures
```

### Best Practices for Adding Tests
1. **Test real processes** when possible (not just mocks)
2. **Include timeout tests** for every blocking operation
3. **Test error messages** include helpful context
4. **Verify cleanup** happens even on failure
5. **Use real CLI programs** (echo, cat, python) for integration
