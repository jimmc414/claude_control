### Best Practices for Adding Tests
1. **Test real processes** when possible (not just mocks)
2. **Include timeout tests** for every blocking operation
3. **Test error messages** include helpful context
4. **Verify cleanup** happens even on failure
5. **Use real CLI programs** (echo, cat, python, sqlite3) for integration
6. **Record and replay tapes** in CI to ensure deterministic parity
